    <p>We created this Privacy Policy (version 04.02.2021-111635504), to declare which information we collect, how we
        use data and which options the users of our website have, according to the guidelines of the <a
                class="adsimple-111635504"
                href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp%3Btid= 111635504"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a>
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature, but we have put much effort into
        describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.</p>
    <h2 id="automatische-datenspeicherung-en" class="adsimple-111635504">Automatic Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and saved, just as it
        happens on this website.</p>
    <p>Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website is
        saved/stored) automatically saves data such as</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">browser and browser version</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">the used operating system</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">date and time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>in files (webserver-logfiles).</p>
    <p>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass this
        information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case of illegal
        conduct.</p>
    <h2 id="cookies-en" class="adsimple-111635504">Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br/>
        For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what
        cookies are and why they are in use.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">What exactly are cookies?</h3>
    <p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
        Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are
        called cookies.</p>
    <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies.
        More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses.
        http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put
        into the cookie-folder, which is like the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value.
        Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
    <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open
        our website, your browser submits these "user specific" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our
        website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its
        own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
    <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
        site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is
        individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a
        few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or
        any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC's information.</p>
    <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">name:</strong> _ga<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152111635504-9<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
    <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
    <p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the
        Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
    <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Essential Cookies<br/>
        </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for
        example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back
        later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure
        that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Purposive Cookies<br/>
        </strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any
        error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website's loading time as well as its behaviour within
        different browsers.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Target-orientated Cookies<br/>
        </strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered
        locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Advertising Cookies<br/>
        </strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually
        adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
    <p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept.
        Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">How can I delete cookies?</h3>
    <p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website
        cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you
        can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>
    <p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your
        browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>

    </p>
    <p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you
        whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either
        permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser.
        Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could
        for example put the search phrase "delete cookies Chrome" or "deactivate cookies Chrome" into Google.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">How is my data protected?</h3>
    <p>There is a "cookie policy" that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the
        user's consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In
        Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>

    <h2 id="google-analytics-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-111635504">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the US-American company Google LLC (1600
        Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Google Analytics collects data on your actions on our
        website. Whenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in a cookie and transferred to Google
        Analytics. With the help of reports which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our
        services better to your wishes. In the following, we will explain the tracking tool in more detail, and most of
        all, we will inform you what data is saved and how you can prevent this.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">What is Google Analytics?</h3>
    <p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data traffic analysis of our website. For
        Google Analytics to work, there is a tracking code integrated to our website. Upon your visit to our website,
        this code records various actions you perform on your website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is
        sent to the Google Analytics server, where it is stored.</p>
    <p>Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user behaviour. These reports can be one of the
        following:</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we can get to
            know our users better and can therefore better understand who is interested in our service.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our online
            advertising better and hence improve it.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful information on how we
            can get more people enthusiastic about our service.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you interact with our
            website. By the means of behaviour reports, we can understand what path you go on our website and what links
            you click.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to carry out a
            desired action due to a marketing message. An example of this would be transforming you from a mere website
            visitor into a buyer or a newsletter subscriber. Hence, with the help of these reports we can see in more
            detail, if our marketing measures are successful with you. Our aim is to increase our conversion rate.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real time, what
            happens on our website. It makes us for example see, we can see how many users are reading this text right
            now.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3>
    <p>The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. Google Analytics'
        statistics and data help us with reaching this goal.</p>
    <p>Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one
        hand, we can optimise our page in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on Google. On the
        other hand, the data helps us to get a better understanding of you as our visitor. Therefore, we can very
        accurately find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the best possible service. The
        analysis of that data also enables us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual
        and more cost-effective way. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services exclusively to
        people who are interested in them.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">What data gets stored by Google Analytics?</h3>
    <p>With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID which is connected to your browser
        cookie. That way, Google Analytics recognises you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be
        recognised as a "recurring" user. All data that is collected gets saved together with this very user ID. Only
        this is how it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user profiles.</p>
    <p>Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies and app instance IDs. Interactions are all
        kinds of actions that you perform on our website. If you are also using other Google systems (such as a Google
        Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked with third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any
        Google Analytics data, unless we as the website owners authorise it. In case it is required by law, exceptions
        can occur.</p>
    <p>The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Name:</strong> _ga<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Value:</strong>2.1326744211.152111635504-5<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Purpose:</strong> By deafault, analytics.js uses the cookie _ga, to save the
        user ID. It generally serves the purpose of differenciating between website visitors.<br/>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Expiration date:</strong> After 2 years</p>

        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Note:</strong> This list is by no means exhaustive, since Google are
        repeatedly changing the use of their cookies.</p>
    <p>Below we will give you an overview of the most important data that can be evaluated by Google Analytics:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates so-called Heatmaps an. These Heatmaps make
        it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can get information on what routes you make on our
        website.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Session duration:</strong> Google calls the time you spend on our website
        without leaving it session duration. Whenever you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Bounce rate</strong> If you only look at one page of our website and then
        leave our website again, it is called a bounce.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Account creation:</strong> If you create an account or make an order on our
        website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">IP-Address:</strong> The IP address is only shown in a shortened form, to
        make it impossible to clearly allocate it.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Location:</strong> Your approximate location and the country you are in can
        be defined by the IP address. This process is called IP location determination.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Technical information:</strong> Information about your browser type, your
        internet provider and your screen resolution are called technical information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Source:</strong> Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves, are interested
        what website or what advertisement led you to our site.</p>
    <p>Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews, playing media (e.g. when you play a video
        on our site), sharing of contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites. This list is not
        exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google Analytics' data retention.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
    <p>Google has servers across the globe. Most of them are in America and therefore your data is mainly saved on
        American servers. Here you can read detailed information on where Google's data centres are located: <a
                class="adsimple-111635504" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a>
    </p>
    <p>Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums. This has the advantage of allowing to retrieve the data
        faster, and of protecting it better from manipulation. Every Google data centre has respective emergency
        programs for your data. Hence, in case of a hardware failure at Google or a server error due to natural
        disasters, the risk for a service interruption stays relatively low.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your user data. After this time, your user data
        is deleted. However, we have the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves. There are
        the following five options:</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Deletion after 14 months</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Deletion after 26 months</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Deletion after 38 months</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Deletion after 50 months</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">No automatical deletion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As soon as the chosen period is expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to any
        of your data which is linked to cookies, user identification and advertisement IDs (e.g. cookies of the
        DoubleClick domain). Any report results are based on aggregated information and are stored independently of any
        user data. Aggregated information is a merge of individual data into a single and bigger unit.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
    <p>Under the provisions of the European Union's data protection law, you have the right to obtain information on
        your data and to update, delete or restrict it. With the help of a browser add on that can deactivate Google
        Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can prevent Google Analytics from using your data. You
        can download this add on at <a class="adsimple-111635504"
                                       href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank"

        consider that this add on can only deactivate any data collection by Google Analytics.</p>

    <h2 id="google-analytics-ip-anonymisierung-en" class="adsimple-111635504">Google Analytics IP Anonymisation</h2>
    <p>We implemented Google Analytics' IP address anonymisation to this website. Google developed this function, so
        this website can comply with the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities'
        recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP addresses.<br/>
        The anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as they reach Google Analytics' data
        collection network, but before the data would be saved or processed.</p>

    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Was genau sind Cookies?</h3>
    <p>Immer wenn Sie durch das Internet surfen, verwenden Sie einen Browser. Bekannte Browser sind beispielsweise
        Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer und Microsoft Edge. Die meisten Webseiten speichern kleine
        Text-Dateien in Ihrem Browser. Diese Dateien nennt man Cookies.</p>
    <p>Eines ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen: Cookies sind echt n&uuml;tzliche Helferlein. Fast alle Webseiten
        verwenden Cookies. Genauer gesprochen sind es HTTP-Cookies, da es auch noch andere Cookies f&uuml;r andere
        Anwendungsbereiche gibt. HTTP-Cookies sind kleine Dateien, die von unserer Webseite auf Ihrem Computer
        gespeichert werden. Diese Cookie-Dateien werden automatisch im Cookie-Ordner, quasi dem "Hirn" Ihres Browsers,
        untergebracht. Ein Cookie besteht aus einem Namen und einem Wert. Bei der Definition eines Cookies m&uuml;ssen
        zus&auml;tzlich ein oder mehrere Attribute angegeben werden.</p>
    <p>Cookies speichern gewisse Nutzerdaten von Ihnen, wie beispielsweise Sprache oder pers&ouml;nliche
        Seiteneinstellungen. Wenn Sie unsere Seite wieder aufrufen, &uuml;bermittelt Ihr Browser die „userbezogenen"
        Informationen an unsere Seite zur&uuml;ck. Dank der Cookies wei&szlig; unsere Webseite, wer Sie sind und bietet
        Ihnen die Einstellung, die Sie gewohnt sind. In einigen Browsern hat jedes Cookie eine eigene Datei, in anderen
        wie beispielsweise Firefox sind alle Cookies in einer einzigen Datei gespeichert.</p>
    <p>Es gibt sowohl Erstanbieter Cookies als auch Drittanbieter-Cookies. Erstanbieter-Cookies werden direkt von
        unserer Seite erstellt, Drittanbieter-Cookies werden von Partner-Webseiten (z.B. Google Analytics)
        erstellt. Jedes Cookie ist individuell zu bewerten, da jedes Cookie andere Daten speichert. Auch die Ablaufzeit

    </ul>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Welche Arten von Cookies gibt es?</h3>
    <p>Die Frage welche Cookies wir im Speziellen verwenden, h&auml;ngt von den verwendeten Diensten ab und wird in den
        folgenden Abschnitten der Datenschutzerkl&auml;rung gekl&auml;rt. An dieser Stelle m&ouml;chten wir kurz auf die
        verschiedenen Arten von HTTP-Cookies eingehen.</p>
    <p>Man kann 4 Arten von Cookies unterscheiden:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Unerl&auml;ssliche Cookies<br/>
        </strong>Diese Cookies sind n&ouml;tig, um grundlegende Funktionen der Webseite sicherzustellen. Zum Beispiel
        braucht es diese Cookies, wenn ein User ein Produkt in den Warenkorb legt, dann auf anderen Seiten weitersurft
        und sp&auml;ter erst zur Kasse geht. Durch diese Cookies wird der Warenkorb nicht gel&ouml;scht, selbst wenn der
        User sein Browserfenster schlie&szlig;t.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Zweckm&auml;&szlig;ige Cookies<br/>
        </strong>Diese Cookies sammeln Infos &uuml;ber das Userverhalten und ob der User etwaige Fehlermeldungen
        bekommt. Zudem werden mithilfe dieser Cookies auch die Ladezeit und das Verhalten der Webseite bei verschiedenen
        Browsern gemessen.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Zielorientierte Cookies<br/>
        </strong>Diese Cookies sorgen f&uuml;r eine bessere Nutzerfreundlichkeit. Beispielsweise werden eingegebene
        Standorte, Schriftgr&ouml;&szlig;en oder Formulardaten gespeichert.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Werbe-Cookies<br/>
        </strong>Diese Cookies werden auch Targeting-Cookies genannt. Sie dienen dazu dem User individuell angepasste
        Werbung zu liefern. Das kann sehr praktisch, aber auch sehr nervig sein.</p>
    <p>&Uuml;blicherweise werden Sie beim erstmaligen Besuch einer Webseite gefragt, welche dieser Cookiearten Sie
        zulassen m&ouml;chten. Und nat&uuml;rlich wird diese Entscheidung auch in einem Cookie gespeichert.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Wie kann ich Cookies l&ouml;schen?</h3>
    <p>Wie und ob Sie Cookies verwenden wollen, entscheiden Sie selbst. Unabh&auml;ngig von welchem Service oder welcher
        Webseite die Cookies stammen, haben Sie immer die M&ouml;glichkeit Cookies zu l&ouml;schen, zu deaktivieren oder
        nur teilweise zuzulassen. Zum Beispiel k&ouml;nnen Sie Cookies von Drittanbietern blockieren, aber alle anderen
        Cookies zulassen.</p>
    <p>Wenn Sie feststellen m&ouml;chten, welche Cookies in Ihrem Browser gespeichert wurden, wenn Sie
        Cookie-Einstellungen &auml;ndern oder l&ouml;schen wollen, k&ouml;nnen Sie dies in Ihren Browser-Einstellungen

    <p>Wir verwenden auf unserer Website das Analyse-Tracking Tool Google Analytics (GA) des amerikanischen Unternehmens
        Google Inc. F&uuml;r den europ&auml;ischen Raum ist das Unternehmen Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow
        Street Dublin 4, Irland) f&uuml;r alle Google-Dienste verantwortlich. Google Analytics sammelt Daten &uuml;ber
        Ihre Handlungen auf unserer Website. Wenn Sie beispielsweise einen Link anklicken, wird diese Aktion in einem
        Cookie gespeichert und an Google Analytics versandt. Mithilfe der Berichte, die wir von Google Analytics
        erhalten, k&ouml;nnen wir unsere Website und unser Service besser an Ihre W&uuml;nsche anpassen. Im Folgenden
        gehen wir n&auml;her auf das Tracking Tool ein und informieren Sie vor allem dar&uuml;ber, welche Daten
        gespeichert werden und wie Sie das verhindern k&ouml;nnen.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Was ist Google Analytics?</h3>
    <p>Google Analytics ist ein Trackingtool, das der Datenverkehrsanalyse unserer Website dient. Damit Google Analytics
        funktioniert, wird ein Tracking-Code in den Code unserer Website eingebaut. Wenn Sie unsere Website besuchen,
        zeichnet dieser Code verschiedene Handlungen auf, die Sie auf unserer Website ausf&uuml;hren. Sobald Sie unsere
        Website verlassen, werden diese Daten an die Google-Analytics-Server gesendet und dort gespeichert.</p>
    <p>Google verarbeitet die Daten und wir bekommen Berichte &uuml;ber Ihr Userverhalten. Dabei kann es sich unter
        anderem um folgende Berichte handeln:</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Zielgruppenberichte: &Uuml;ber Zielgruppenberichte lernen wir unsere User besser
            kennen und wissen genauer, wer sich f&uuml;r unser Service interessiert.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Anzeigeberichte: Durch Anzeigeberichte k&ouml;nnen wir unsere Onlinewerbung
            leichter analysieren und verbessern.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Akquisitionsberichte: Akquisitionsberichte geben uns hilfreiche Informationen dar&uuml;ber,
            wie wir mehr Menschen f&uuml;r unser Service begeistern k&ouml;nnen.

        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Verhaltensberichte: Hier erfahren wir, wie Sie mit unserer Website interagieren.
            Wir k&ouml;nnen nachvollziehen welchen Weg Sie auf unserer Seite zur&uuml;cklegen und welche Links Sie
            anklicken.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Conversionsberichte: Conversion nennt man einen Vorgang, bei dem Sie aufgrund
            einer Marketing-Botschaft eine gew&uuml;nschte Handlung ausf&uuml;hren. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie von einem
            reinen Websitebesucher zu einem K&auml;ufer oder Newsletter-Abonnent werden. Mithilfe dieser Berichte
            erfahren wir mehr dar&uuml;ber, wie unsere Marketing-Ma&szlig;nahmen bei Ihnen ankommen. So wollen wir
            unsere Conversionrate steigern.

    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Warum verwenden wir Google Analytics auf unserer Webseite?</h3>
    <p>Unser Ziel mit dieser Website ist klar: Wir wollen Ihnen das bestm&ouml;gliche Service bieten. Die Statistiken
        und Daten von Google Analytics helfen uns dieses Ziel zu erreichen.</p>
    <p>Die statistisch ausgewerteten Daten zeigen uns ein klares Bild von den St&auml;rken und Schw&auml;chen unserer
        Website. Einerseits k&ouml;nnen wir unsere Seite so optimieren, dass sie von interessierten Menschen auf Google
        leichter gefunden wird. Andererseits helfen uns die Daten, Sie als Besucher besser zu verstehen. Wir wissen
        somit sehr genau, was wir an unserer Website verbessern m&uuml;ssen, um Ihnen das bestm&ouml;gliche Service zu
        bieten. Die Daten dienen uns auch, unsere Werbe- und Marketing-Ma&szlig;nahmen individueller und kosteng&uuml;nstiger
        durchzuf&uuml;hren. Schlie&szlig;lich macht es nur Sinn, unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen Menschen zu
        zeigen, die sich daf&uuml;r interessieren.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Welche Daten werden von Google Analytics gespeichert?</h3>
    <p>Google Analytics erstellt mithilfe eines Tracking-Codes eine zuf&auml;llige, eindeutige ID, die mit Ihrem
        Browser-Cookie verbunden ist. So erkennt Sie Google Analytics als neuen User. Wenn Sie das n&auml;chste Mal
        unsere Seite besuchen, werden Sie als „wiederkehrender" User erkannt. Alle gesammelten Daten werden gemeinsam
        mit dieser User-ID gespeichert. So ist es &uuml;berhaupt erst m&ouml;glich pseudonyme Userprofile
        auszuwerten.</p>
    <p>Durch Kennzeichnungen wie Cookies und App-Instanz-IDs werden Ihre Interaktionen auf unserer Website gemessen.
        Interaktionen sind alle Arten von Handlungen, die Sie auf unserer Website ausf&uuml;hren. Wenn Sie auch andere
        Google-Systeme (wie z.B. ein Google-Konto) n&uuml;tzen, k&ouml;nnen &uuml;ber Google Analytics generierte Daten
        mit Drittanbieter-Cookies verkn&uuml;pft werden. Google gibt keine Google Analytics-Daten weiter, au&szlig;er
        wir als Websitebetreiber genehmigen das. Zu Ausnahmen kann es kommen, wenn es gesetzlich erforderlich ist.</p>

        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Anmerkung:</strong> Diese Aufz&auml;hlung kann keinen Anspruch auf Vollst&auml;ndigkeit
        erheben, da Google die Wahl ihrer Cookies immer wieder auch ver&auml;ndert.</p>
    <p>Hier zeigen wir Ihnen einen &Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber die wichtigsten Daten, die mit Google Analytics erhoben
        werden:</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Heatmaps:</strong> Google legt sogenannte Heatmaps an. &Uuml;ber Heatmaps
        sieht man genau jene Bereiche, die Sie anklicken. So bekommen wir Informationen, wo Sie auf unserer Seite
        „unterwegs" sind.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Sitzungsdauer:</strong> Als Sitzungsdauer bezeichnet Google die Zeit, die Sie
        auf unserer Seite verbringen, ohne die Seite zu verlassen. Wenn Sie 20 Minuten inaktiv waren, endet die Sitzung
        automatisch.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Absprungrate</strong> (engl. Bouncerate): Von einem Absprung ist die Rede,
        wenn Sie auf unserer Website nur eine Seite ansehen und dann unsere Website wieder verlassen.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Kontoerstellung:</strong> Wenn Sie auf unserer Website ein Konto erstellen
        bzw. eine Bestellung machen, erhebt Google Analytics diese Daten.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">IP-Adresse:</strong> Die IP-Adresse wird nur in gek&uuml;rzter Form
        dargestellt, damit keine eindeutige Zuordnung m&ouml;glich ist.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Standort:</strong> &Uuml;ber die IP-Adresse kann das Land und Ihr ungef&auml;hrer
        Standort bestimmt werden. Diesen Vorgang bezeichnet man auch als IP- Standortbestimmung.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Technische Informationen:</strong> Zu den technischen Informationen z&auml;hlen
        unter anderem Ihr Browsertyp, Ihr Internetanbieter oder Ihre Bildschirmaufl&ouml;sung.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-111635504">Herkunftsquelle:</strong> Google Analytics beziehungsweise uns interessiert
        nat&uuml;rlich auch &uuml;ber welche Website oder welche Werbung Sie auf unsere Seite gekommen sind.</p>
    <p>Weitere Daten sind Kontaktdaten, etwaige Bewertungen, das Abspielen von Medien (z.B., wenn Sie ein Video &uuml;ber
        unsere Seite abspielen), das Teilen von Inhalten &uuml;ber Social Media oder das Hinzuf&uuml;gen zu Ihren
        Favoriten. Die Aufz&auml;hlung hat keinen Vollst&auml;ndigkeitsanspruch und dient nur zu einer allgemeinen
        Orientierung der Datenspeicherung durch Google Analytics.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Wie lange und wo werden die Daten gespeichert?</h3>
    <p>Google hat Ihre Server auf der ganzen Welt verteilt. Die meisten Server befinden sich in Amerika und folglich
        werden Ihre Daten meist auf amerikanischen Servern gespeichert. Hier k&ouml;nnen Sie genau nachlesen wo sich die
        Google-Rechenzentren befinden: <a class="adsimple-111635504"
                                          href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de"
                                          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de</a>
    </p>
    <p>Ihre Daten werden auf verschiedenen physischen Datentr&auml;gern verteilt. Das hat den Vorteil, dass die Daten
        schneller abrufbar sind und vor Manipulation besser gesch&uuml;tzt sind. In jedem Google-Rechenzentrum gibt es
        entsprechende Notfallprogramme f&uuml;r Ihre Daten. Wenn beispielsweise die Hardware bei Google ausf&auml;llt
        oder Naturkatastrophen Server lahmlegen, bleibt das Risiko einer Dienstunterbrechung bei Google dennoch
        gering.</p>
    <p>Standardisiert ist bei Google Analytics eine Aufbewahrungsdauer Ihrer Userdaten von 26 Monaten eingestellt. Dann
        werden Ihre Userdaten gel&ouml;scht. Allerdings haben wir die M&ouml;glichkeit, die Aufbewahrungsdauer von
        Nutzdaten selbst zu w&auml;hlen. Daf&uuml;r stehen uns f&uuml;nf Varianten zur Verf&uuml;gung:</p>
    <ul class="adsimple-111635504">
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">L&ouml;schung nach 14 Monaten</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">L&ouml;schung nach 26 Monaten</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">L&ouml;schung nach 38 Monaten</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">L&ouml;schung nach 50 Monaten</li>
        <li class="adsimple-111635504">Keine automatische L&ouml;schung</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wenn der festgelegte Zeitraum abgelaufen ist, werden einmal im Monat die Daten gel&ouml;scht. Diese
        Aufbewahrungsdauer gilt f&uuml;r Ihre Daten, die mit Cookies, Usererkennung und Werbe-IDs (z.B. Cookies der
        DoubleClick-Domain) verkn&uuml;pft sind. Berichtergebnisse basieren auf aggregierten Daten und werden unabh&auml;ngig
        von Nutzerdaten gespeichert. Aggregierte Daten sind eine Zusammenschmelzung von Einzeldaten zu einer gr&ouml;&szlig;eren
        Einheit.</p>
    <h3 class="adsimple-111635504">Wie kann ich meine Daten l&ouml;schen bzw. die Datenspeicherung verhindern?</h3>
    <p>Nach dem Datenschutzrecht der Europ&auml;ischen Union haben Sie das Recht, Auskunft &uuml;ber Ihre Daten zu
        erhalten, sie zu aktualisieren, zu l&ouml;schen oder einzuschr&auml;nken. Mithilfe des Browser-Add-ons zur
        Deaktivierung von Google Analytics-JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js) verhindern Sie, dass Google Analytics
        Ihre Daten verwendet. Das Browser-Add-on k&ouml;nnen Sie unter <a class="adsimple-111635504"

        runterladen und installieren. Beachten Sie bitte, dass durch dieses Add-on nur die Datenerhebung durch Google
        Analytics deaktiviert wird.</p>

    <h2 id="google-analytics-ip-anonymisierung" class="adsimple-111635504">Google Analytics IP-Anonymisierung</h2>
    <p>Wir haben auf dieser Webseite die IP-Adressen-Anonymisierung von Google Analytics implementiert. Diese Funktion
        wurde von Google entwickelt, damit diese Webseite die geltenden Datenschutzbestimmungen und Empfehlungen der
        lokalen Datenschutzbeh&ouml;rden einhalten kann, wenn diese eine Speicherung der vollst&auml;ndigen IP-Adresse
        untersagen. Die Anonymisierung bzw. Maskierung der IP findet statt, sobald die IP-Adressen im Google
        Analytics-Datenerfassungsnetzwerk eintreffen und bevor eine Speicherung oder Verarbeitung der Daten
        stattfindet.</p>
